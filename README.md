## Introduction
In this lab, we aim to simulate a real-world scenario by setting up an Active Directory environment at home. By doing so, we'll explore how domain environments work, learn to ingest events into a SIEM (Splunk), and generate telemetry related to attacks seen in the wild to enhance our detection capabilities.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up your cybersecurity lab environment:

1. **Hardware Requirements**: Ensure your system meets the hardware requirements for running the lab environment.
2. **Software Requirements**: Install necessary software including VirtualBox, Splunk, Kali Linux, etc.
3. **Active Directory Setup**: Step-by-step guide to setting up an Active Directory domain controller.
4. **Splunk Installation**: Instructions for installing and configuring Splunk for event ingestion.
5. **Kali Linux Setup**: Guidance on setting up Kali Linux for penetration testing.
6. **Atomic Red Team Integration**: Integration steps for Atomic Red Team to simulate real-world attacks.

## Lab Exercises
This section contains a series of practical exercises to perform in your lab environment. Each exercise focuses on a specific aspect of cybersecurity and helps you develop practical skills:

1. **Exercise 1**: Basic Active Directory Administration
2. **Exercise 2**: Ingesting Events into Splunk
